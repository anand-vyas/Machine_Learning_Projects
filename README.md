# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains several machine learning projects I have worked on.
*** Recommendation Engine using Collaborative Filtering ***

This was a large scale, semester long project. 

We used the Scrum Framework for developing this project. Python was the language of our choice and the entire project has been built from scratch without using any tools/ API's. 

We implemented the Collaborative Filtering Algorithm using the User - User Approach. We have used the Pearson Similarity Coefficient, for measuring the similarity between users. 

We used an open source Book Dataset (CSV files) and wrote a Python Script to extract the required data into a particular format. Despite of the large dataset, we were able to achieve a small Root Mean Square Error on the accuracy of predicted ratings. 

We measured both one and multifold accuracies. 

We also researched extensively on the methods used by the winning team of the NetFlix Prize.

We researched on and presented the following algorithms in class: Normalization of Global Effects, Neighborhood Models, Implicit Data, Matrix Factorization, Regression, Restricted Botlzmann Machines, Temporal Effects, Regularization and Ensemble Methods.
